## Input Data Format
### Phenotype file

The input phenotype file need to be an n x 3 table, where n is the sample size. The columns in order are the FID, IID, and the phenotype. Here is an example of the phenotype file `pheno.txt`:
```
FID	IID	bmi
1	1	31.0920070855422
2	2	34.9722947258896
3	3	26.651358296193
4	4	11.3265202767703
5	5	28.1784063613473
...
...
```


### Covariate file

The input Covariate file needs to be an n x (m+2) table, where m is the number of covariates to include. The columns in order are the FID, IID, and the covariates. Here is an example of the covariate file `covar.txt`:

```
FID	IID	sex	age	pc1
1	1	0	40	0.0496566810517587
2	2	1	41	-0.30689382604118
3	3	1	42	0.0662231532694345
4	4	0	43	0.653681021333332
5	5	1	44	0.50856163868585
...
...
```

### Environment/SNP file for interaction analysis

The input Covariate file needs to be an n x 3 table, where n is the sample size. The columns in order are the FID, IID, and the Environment/SNP for interaction test **(Note: the third colnams of the table must be `I`)**. Here is an example of the phenotype file `interaction.txt`:

```
FID	IID	I
1	1	1
2	2	0
3	3	1
4	4	1
5	5	1
...
...
```


### Genotype file

The input genotype file needs to be in the plink bed/bim/fam format. The path only includes the prefix, not the suffix. For example, the path to the input genotype file is `geno` where the genotype files are `geno.bed, geno.bim, geno.fam`.



## Genome-wide GxE or GxG analysis


#### Example:
The following script perform genome-wide GxE interaction analysis from the `1`-`1000` SNPs in plink genotype file `geno` for phenotype `pheno.txt`.  This analysis adjusted the covaraites in `covar.txt` and `5` cores are used for parallel computing. 
```bash
$ Rscript SGEGG.R \
  --pheno pheno.txt \
  --geno geno \
  --covar covar.txt \
  --interaction interaction.txt \
  --output output_1-100.txt \
  --num_cores 5 \
  --type GxE \
  --start 1 \
  --end 1000
```
where the inputs are

| Flag | Description |
|-----|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| pheno     | The path to phenotype file|
| geno         | The path of the genotype file following the [PLINK format](https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/1.9). |
| covar        | The path to the covariate file |
| interaction       | The path to the variable of interaction file |  
| output     | The path to the output summary statistics file |
| num_cores        | Number of cores for parallel computing |
| type        | GxE or GxG analysis (This will only change the columns names for output)  |
| start          | (Optional) Index of SNP that starts computing |
| end       | (Optional) Index of SNP that ends computing |

Note that 

* The script is designed to run on chromosome segments to facilitate parallel computation on the cluster. If `--start` or `--end` is not specified, the script will perform the analysis on all SNPs in the plink `test` file.
